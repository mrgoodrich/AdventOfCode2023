# AdventOfCode2023

In past years I have used JavaScript, but I want to learn something new this year. I have worked with minimal Python in the industry, but most of my classes in school were based on Java. This year I will use Python. I will follow along with @oliver-ni and clone their setup at https://github.com/oliver-ni/advent-of-code/tree/master. Thanks Oliver!
